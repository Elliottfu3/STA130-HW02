At the beginning, I thought that I could solve the problem well just by relying on AI-driven auxiliary tools, but I found that relying on such tools a lot would not help me understand the knowledge, and it would also make mistakes and I needed to check it myself, so I thought it could only be an auxiliary tool, and I no longer regarded it as a tool that led my learning.\n",

Communication is essential for explaining complex findings to non-technical stakeholders. Statistics provides the theoretical foundation, but coding is essential for effectively applying these concepts. While statisticians may only need very little coding, in the field of data science, coding and hands-on analysis are essential for success. In summary, without coding, it is difficult to effectively carry out tasks such as statistical data analysis, so I think what ChatGPT means is that I can't be a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis."
