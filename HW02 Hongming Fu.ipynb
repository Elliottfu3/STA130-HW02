Statistics provides the theoretical foundation, but coding is essential for effectively applying these concepts. While statisticians may only need very little coding, in the field of data science, coding and hands-on analysis are essential for success. In summary, without coding, it is difficult to effectively carry out tasks such as statistical data analysis, so I think what ChatGPT means is that I can't be a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis."
